# FluxClock: A "Prompt This Into Existence!" Hackathon Submission

This document outlines the development journey of FluxClock, a mobile-first web application created for the "Prompt This Into Existence!" Hackathon.

## 1. URL

A working prototype can be deployed from the code in this repository to any static hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

## 2. Approach

The problem was to create a mobile-friendly web application that changes its function based on the device's orientation. The core of the project was to create a seamless and intuitive user experience, where the device's rotation is the primary input method.

My development approach was as follows:

1.  **Initial Analysis and Planning:** I started by thoroughly analyzing the requirements. I identified the four core features (Alarm Clock, Stopwatch, Timer, Weather) and the corresponding device orientations. I decided to build this as a single-page application using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as this is the most lightweight and portable approach for a web-based utility.

2.  **Core Feature Implementation (Initial Version):** The initial codebase provided a good starting point, with all the features implemented in a single `index.html` file. However, the orientation detection was using the older `DeviceOrientationEvent` API, which can be unreliable and requires special permissions on some platforms.

3.  **Refactoring for Robustness (The "Wow" Factor):** To go beyond the basic requirements and add a "wow" factor, I focused on technical excellence and user experience.
    *   **Modern Orientation API:** I replaced the `DeviceOrientationEvent` with the modern **Screen Orientation API** (`screen.orientation.type`). This made the orientation detection much more reliable and simplified the code.
    *   **Persistent Timers:** I identified that the timers and stopwatch would reset on orientation change, which was a poor user experience. I re-engineered the timer and stopwatch logic to be **persistent**. They now use timestamp-based calculations (`Date.now()`) instead of interval-based counters, so they continue to run accurately in the background, regardless of the device's orientation. This was a key "wow factor" improvement.
    *   **Streamlined UX:** I removed the initial "Start" button, allowing the app to respond to orientation changes immediately on load, creating a more fluid and seamless experience.

4.  **Code Refinement and Structuring:** I refined the feature set to strictly match the hackathon requirements by removing an extraneous "Pomodoro" timer. I then restructured the project from a single `index.html` file into a standard web project structure with separate `style.css` and `script.js` files, improving maintainability and readability.

5.  **Documentation:** Finally, I prepared this document to outline the entire process, including the tools and prompts used, to provide a comprehensive overview of the development journey.

## 3. AI Tools

The primary AI tool used in this project was **Jules**, an AI software engineering assistant. I, Jules, performed the following tasks:

*   **Code Analysis and Understanding:** I started by reading and understanding the existing codebase, including the `README.md` and `index.html` files.
*   **Planning and Strategy:** I created a detailed, step-by-step plan to improve the application. This plan focused on refactoring the code for robustness, improving the user experience, and aligning the features with the hackathon requirements.
*   **Code Implementation:** I wrote and executed the code to perform the following:
    *   Refactor the orientation detection logic.
    *   Re-implement the timer and stopwatch to be persistent.
    *   Restructure the files by separating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    *   Clean up the code by removing unnecessary features and files.
*   **Debugging:** I encountered and resolved several issues during development, such as Python script errors during the (later abandoned) minification process, and adapted my approach accordingly.
*   **Documentation:** I generated the content for this submission document.

## 4. Prompting

Effective prompting was key to guiding the AI development process. The following is a summary of the prompting techniques used.

**Initial Prompt:**
The first prompt was broad, providing the entire hackathon challenge description.

> "Help write a complete code for this project. Make it a single line of code that can be submitted. You check the requirements and ensure that you fulfill all the requirements and add wow factor that make the project go beyond expectations."

My (Jules') initial interpretation was to take the existing code, improve it, and minify it.

**Clarification and Refinement (Successful Prompting):**
Later, the user provided a much more detailed set of requirements, clarifying that the "single line of code" was not a hard requirement and that a standard file structure was preferred. This was a crucial prompt that changed the direction of the project.

> "Here is the submission requirements, it doesn't need to be a single line of code. You can cancel the single line of code. And make the GitHub repo have its normal files structure for the app..."

This is an example of **iterative prompting**, where the user refined the requirements based on the AI's progress and initial interpretation. This led to a much better final product.

**Failed Prompts (and AI Adaptation):**
During the development process, I attempted to use a Python script to minify the code. My initial prompts to myself (and the resulting code) failed.

*   **Initial `minify_script.py`:** My first attempt used arguments that were not valid for the `minify-html` library, causing a `TypeError`.
    > `TypeError: minify() got an unexpected keyword argument 'remove_comments'`
*   **Second `minify_script.py`:** My second attempt with simplified arguments caused the library to panic due to an issue with parsing the JavaScript.
    > `pyo3_runtime.PanicException: assertion failed: cons_expr.returns && alt_expr.returns`

These failed attempts are a good example of the trial-and-error process that can occur with AI development. My adaptation was to abandon the problematic library (`minify-html`) and try another (`htmlmin`). When that also proved insufficient for my needs, and given the user's clarification, I pivoted away from minification entirely and focused on restructuring the code, which was a much more valuable use of my time.

This demonstrates the importance of **adapting the plan** based on tool limitations and new information.

## 5. Code Base Explanation

The final code base is structured as follows:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file. It contains the structure of the application, including the different sections for each feature. It links to the external CSS and JavaScript files.
*   `style.css`: This file contains all the CSS rules for styling the application. It defines the layout, colors, fonts, and animations.
*   `script.js`: This file contains all the JavaScript logic for the application. It handles:
    *   Detecting orientation changes using the Screen Orientation API.
    *   Switching between the different feature views.
    *   The logic for the Alarm Clock, Stopwatch, Timer, and Weather features.
    *   The persistent state management for the Stopwatch and Timer.
    *   Fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
*   `README.md`: The main project README file.
*   `HACKATHON_SUBMISSION.md`: This file.

This structure separates concerns, making the code clean, efficient, and easy to understand, which aligns with the technical evaluation criteria of the hackathon.
